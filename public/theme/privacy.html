                      information from you, which may include your name, email address, mobile
                      phone number, banking information, and other information that identifies you

                      such as a username and password. When you provide your mobile phone number,
                      we may ask for your consent to receive text messages relating to our Services
                      at that number.</p>
                      <h3>Information About Your Transactions</h3>

                      <p>We also collect Personal Information about you from other companies. For
                      instance, we may receive Personal Information about you from a consumer

                      aggregate information about usage of our Services. A cookie is a text file or
                      other local storage identifier provided by your browser or associated
                      applications. We use cookies for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the
                      quality of your use of our Services. The cookies assign random, unique
                      numbers to your Devices to enable our systems to recognize your Devices and
                      to allow us to see how you use our Services. Additional general information
                      about cookies and how they work is available at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

                      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Session cookies</span>: Session
                      cookies are temporary cookies that expire and are automatically erased
                      whenever you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant users
                      access to content and to enable actions they must be logged into their PiggyVest                      account to perform.</p>
                
                      <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Persistent cookies</span>:
                      Persistent cookies usually have an expiration date in the distant future and
                      remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them. We use
                      persistent cookies to better understand usage patterns so we can improve our
                      Services. For example, we may use a persistent cookie to associate you with
                      your PiggyVest account or to remember your choices for our Services.</p>

                      "text-decoration: underline;">party cookies</span>: We permit certain third
                      parties to place cookies through our Services to provide us with better
                      insights into the use of our Services and user demographics and to advertise
                      our Services to you. These third parties may collect information about your
                      online activities over time and across different websites when you access or
                      use our Services. For example, we utilize Google Analytics to analyze usage
                      patterns for our Services. Google Analytics generates a cookie to capture
                      information about your use of our Services, which Google uses to compile
                      reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services.
                      Google may use a portion of your IP address to identify its cookie, but this
                      will not be associated with any other data held by Google. We may also permit
                      third-party service providers to place cookies for our Services, as indicated
                      above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified of
