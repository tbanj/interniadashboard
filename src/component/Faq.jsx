For example, if you set N1,000 daily and you miss a day or two, you can use the quick save option to deposit N2,000 or N3,000 at once. This is to ensure you meet up with your savings target.<br/><br/>You can add up to N500,000 at once with this option. However, you can add this multiple times in a single day. For instance, if you want to add N1,000,000, you need to add N500,000 twice.</p>
