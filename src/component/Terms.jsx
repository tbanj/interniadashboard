                <h2>How do I use the Services?</h2>
                <p>The purpose of the Services is to try to help you save money with minimal effort. We
                debit your debit card (the amount you specify). You can request for your savings at anytime on any of our pay out days. Only funds from your debit card may be
                transferred to your PiggyVest Account. The funds in your PiggyVest Account are held at a bank for your benefit.</p>
            
                <p>Your funds will remain in your PiggyVest Account until you instruct us to transfer any
                or all of your funds from your PiggyVest Account to your Bank Account by emailing us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#e98a86879d888a9da999808e8e909f8c9a9dc78a8684"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0b6864657f6a687f4b7b626c6c727d6e787f25686466">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. We will generally transfer
                the requested funds from your PiggyVest Account to your Bank Account within two Business
                Days of when we receive your request. It is important to know the amount of available
                funds in your PiggyVest Account before instructing us to transfer funds from your PiggyVest                Account to your Bank Account. If you do not have sufficient available funds in your
                PiggyVest Account to cover the amount of the requested transfer, your request for the
                transfer will be declined. We may also transfer funds from your PiggyVest Account to your
                Bank Account without notice to you upon the closure of your PiggyVest Account as described
                below and at any time if required by applicable law or if we, in our sole discretion,

                for determining whether the funds debited from your debit card and the funds
                maintained in your PiggyVest Account are acceptable to you. We are not responsible for any
                third-party fees that may be incurred as a result of using the Services, including, but
                not limited to, third-party fees incurred as a result of maintaining insufficient funds
                in your Bank Account.</p>

                transactions. We do not make any representations, warranties, or guarantees of any kind

                agreement that you may have had with us) if such third party is named as a co-party
                with us in any controversy, dispute, demand, claim, or cause of action subject to this
                Section.</p>
            
                <p>Arbitration will be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act and not any state
                arbitration law. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator
                from the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act with substantial experience in resolving
                commercial contract disputes. As modified by these Terms, and unless otherwise agreed
                upon by the parties in writing, the arbitration will be governed by the Nigeria Arbitration and Conciliation Act&rsquo;s
                Commercial Arbitration Rules and, if the arbitrator deems them applicable, the
                Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the "<span style=
                {{textDecoration: 'underline'}}>Rules and Procedures</span>").</p>
            
                <p>You should review this provision carefully. To the extent permitted by applicable
                law, you are GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights EXCEPT
                for matters that you file in small claims court in the state or municipality of your
                residence within the jurisdictional limits of the small claims court and as long as
                such matter is only pending in that court. Additionally, notwithstanding this agreement
                to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency equitable relief in federal court if it
                has jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial
                district of your residence in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration, and
                each party hereby agrees to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the courts
                located within the federal judicial district of your residence for such purpose. A
                request for interim measures will not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to
                arbitrate.</p>
            
                <p>Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury. You
                are entitled to a FAIR HEARING, BUT the arbitration procedures may be SIMPLER AND MORE
                LIMITED THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN COURT. Arbitrators&rsquo; decisions are as enforceable
                as any court order and are subject to VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT.</p>
            
                <p>You and we must abide by the following rules: (A) ANY CLAIMS BROUGHT BY YOU OR US
                MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
                CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (B) THE ARBITRATOR
                MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S CLAIMS, MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER
                ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND MAY NOT AWARD CLASS-WIDE RELIEF;
                (c) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be
                prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing
                and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary
                to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the cost of
                litigation, (d) we also reserve the right, in our sole and exclusive discretion, to
                assume responsibility for any or all of the costs of the arbitration; (e) the
                arbitrator will honor claims of privilege and privacy recognized at law; (f) the
                arbitration will be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence,
                content, or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by applicable law or
                for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award; (g) subject to the limitation of
                liability provisions of these Terms, the arbitrator may award any individual relief or
                individual remedies that are expressly permitted by applicable law; and (h) each party
                will pay its own attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, unless there is a statutory
                provision that requires the prevailing party to be paid its fees and litigation
                expenses and the arbitrator awards such attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses to the
                prevailing party, and, in such instance, the fees and costs awarded will be determined
                by the applicable law.</p>
            
                <p>This Section will survive termination of your PiggyVest Account and these Terms as well
                as any voluntary payment of any debt in full by you or any bankruptcy by you or us.
                With the exception of subparts (a) and (b) of this Section (prohibiting arbitration on
                a class or collective basis), if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be
                invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and
                Procedures, then the balance of this arbitration provision will remain in effect and
                will be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable,
                illegal, or conflicting part was not contained herein. If, however, either subpart (a)
                or (b) of this Section is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the
                entirety of this arbitration provision will be null and void, and neither you nor we
                will be entitled to arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather
                than in arbitration, the dispute will be exclusively brought in federal court if it has
                jurisdiction or, if it does not, in a state court located in the federal judicial
                district of your residence.</p>
            
                <p>If you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision, you must notify us of your
                election in writing within 30 days of the date that you first became subject to this
                arbitration provision or within 30 days of the effective date of any material change to
                these Terms by sending a written notice to us by certified mail at the following
                address: PiggyTech Global Limited, Physical Office Address: No. 16, Boyle Street, Lagos Island, Lagos, Nigeria.,
                Attn: Arbitration Opt-Out. Your opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone

                responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other
                governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services,
                provided that we may, in our sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or
                for ourselves. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right
                herein will not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of
                these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
                eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms will otherwise remain
                in full force and effect and enforceable. These Terms, together with our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, constitute
                the entire and sole agreement between you and us with respect to the Services and
                supersedes all prior understandings, arrangements, or agreements, whether written or
                oral, regarding the Services. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an
                employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of PiggyVest, and you do not have any authority
                of any kind to bind PiggyVest in any respect whatsoever.</p>
